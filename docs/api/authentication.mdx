## Current Status

<Warning>
  Authentication is not currently implemented in Voicebox. The API is intended for local use only.
</Warning>

## Local Usage

For local development and usage:
- API runs on `localhost:17493`
- No authentication required
- Access restricted to local machine

## Future Implementation

Authentication will be added in a future release for:
- Remote deployments
- Multi-user access
- Production environments

Planned authentication methods:
- API keys
- OAuth 2.0
- JWT tokens

## Security Best Practices

Until authentication is implemented:

  <Card title="Use VPN" icon="shield">
    Use WireGuard or Tailscale for remote access
  </Card>
  <Card title="Reverse Proxy" icon="server">
    Run behind nginx with basic auth
  </Card>
  <Card title="Firewall" icon="fire">
    Restrict access to trusted IPs only
  </Card>
  <Card title="Local Only" icon="laptop">
    Don't expose to public internet
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Coming Soon
