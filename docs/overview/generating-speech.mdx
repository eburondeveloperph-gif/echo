## Text Formatting Tips

The way you format text affects the output quality.

### Punctuation

Use proper punctuation for natural pauses:

```
Good: "Hello! How are you today? I'm doing great."
Bad: "Hello how are you today Im doing great"
```

### Emphasis

Use formatting to suggest emphasis:

```
- ALL CAPS for louder/emphasized: "That was AMAZING!"
- Italics for subtle emphasis: "I *really* enjoyed that"
- Bold for strong emphasis: "This is **very** important"
```

<Note>
  The model interprets these hints but results may vary.
