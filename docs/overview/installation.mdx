### Linux

<Note>
  Linux builds are coming soon. Currently blocked by GitHub runner disk space limitations.
</Note>

## First Launch

When you launch Voicebox for the first time:

1. **Model Download** — Qwen3-TTS model (~2-4GB) will download automatically on first use
2. **Data Directory** — Voice profiles and generated audio are stored in:
   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/com.voicebox.app/`
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%/com.voicebox.app/`
   - Linux: `~/.config/com.voicebox.app/`

3. **Backend Server** — The bundled Python server starts automatically

<Tip>
  First generation will be slower due to model downloads. Subsequent runs use cached models.
</Tip>

## System Requirements

### Minimum

- **OS:** macOS 11+, Windows 10+, or Linux
- **RAM:** 8GB
- **Storage:** 5GB free space (for models and data)
- **CPU:** Modern multi-core processor

### Recommended

- **RAM:** 16GB+
- **GPU:** CUDA-capable NVIDIA GPU (for faster generation)
- **Storage:** 10GB+ free space

<Note>
  CPU inference is supported but significantly slower than GPU. A CUDA-capable GPU is highly recommended for real-time workflows.
</Note>

## Verification

After installation, verify everything works:

1. Launch Voicebox
2. Check the server status indicator in the bottom-left corner (should be green)
3. Navigate to **Profiles** and create a test profile
4. Generate a short audio clip to verify the TTS engine works

<Check>
  If you see a green status indicator and can generate audio, you're all set!
</Check>
