description: "Connect to a GPU server for faster generation"

## Overview

Remote Mode allows you to run the Voicebox backend on a separate machine (like a GPU server) while using the desktop app on your local machine.

## Use Cases

- **No local GPU** - Use a cloud GPU or remote workstation
- **Faster generation** - Leverage powerful remote hardware
- **Shared infrastructure** - Multiple users connect to one server
- **Laptop workflows** - Keep your laptop cool and battery-efficient

## Architecture

In Remote Mode, the Voicebox desktop app (running on your local machine) communicates with the backend server (running on a remote machine) via HTTP. The local app provides only the user interface, while the remote server handles all the heavy processing including the TTS models, API endpoints, and audio generation.

## Setting Up Remote Mode

### On the Server

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Dependencies">
    ```bash
    # Clone the repo
    git clone https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox.git
    cd voicebox/backend

    # Install Python dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install git+https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3-TTS.git
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start the Server">
    ```bash
    # Allow external connections
    uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 17493
    ```

    <Warning>
      This exposes the server to your network. Use a firewall or VPN for security.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open Firewall">
    ```bash
    # Ubuntu/Debian
    sudo ufw allow 17493

    # Or use your cloud provider's firewall settings
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### On the Client

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Settings">
    In Voicebox, go to **Settings → Server**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable Remote Mode">
    Toggle **Use Remote Server**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter Server URL">
    ```
    http://<server-ip>:17493
    ```

    Replace `<server-ip>` with your server's IP address
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Connection">
    Click **Test Connection** to verify
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Cloud Deployment

### AWS EC2

```bash
# Launch a GPU instance (e.g., g4dn.xlarge)
# Install dependencies
# Start server with --host 0.0.0.0
```

### Vast.ai

```bash
# Rent a GPU instance
# SSH in and clone repo
# Start server
```

### RunPod

```bash
# Deploy a pod with CUDA support
# Install Voicebox backend
# Expose port 17493
```

## Security Considerations

<Warning>
  The API currently has no authentication. Only use on trusted networks or with a VPN.
</Warning>

**Best Practices:**
- Use a VPN (WireGuard, Tailscale) instead of exposing to the internet
- Run behind a reverse proxy with authentication (nginx + basic auth)
- Use HTTPS with SSL certificates
- Firewall rules to limit access to specific IPs

## Performance

Expected performance on various GPUs:

| GPU | Generation Speed |
|-----|------------------|
| RTX 4090 | ~2-3s per 10 words |
| RTX 3090 | ~3-4s per 10 words |
| RTX 3060 | ~5-7s per 10 words |
| CPU (12-core) | ~20-30s per 10 words |

<Tip>
  A GPU with 8GB+ VRAM is recommended for best performance.
