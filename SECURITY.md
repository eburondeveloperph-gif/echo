1. **Do not** open a public GitHub issue
2. Email security details to: [security@eburon-echo.sh](mailto:security@eburon-echo.sh)
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

- **Keep Eburon Echo updated** - Updates include security patches
- **Verify downloads** - Only download from official releases
- **Local processing** - Voice data stays on your machine
- **Network security** - Use HTTPS when connecting to remote servers

### For Developers

- **Dependencies** - Keep all dependencies up to date
- **Code review** - All PRs require review before merging
- **Secrets** - Never commit API keys or signing keys
- **Signing** - All releases are cryptographically signed

## Known Security Considerations

### Local Processing

Eburon Echo processes all audio locally by default. Your voice data never leaves your machine unless you explicitly enable remote server mode.

### Remote Server Mode

When connecting to a remote server:
- Ensure the server is on a trusted network
- Use HTTPS for remote connections
- Verify server identity before connecting

### Auto-Updates

- Updates are cryptographically signed
- Signature verification happens before installation
- Only HTTPS endpoints are allowed

### Python Server

The embedded Python server:
- Runs locally by default (localhost only)
- Can be configured for remote access
- Uses standard FastAPI security practices

- **Day 1-2**: Initial assessment and acknowledgment
